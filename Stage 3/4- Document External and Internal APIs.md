# API Specifications

## External APIs

integrates four external services. All credentials are stored in environment variables and never hardcoded.

### Authentica (OTP Verification)
Used for email and SMS one-time password verification. The OTP code itself is never stored locally — only Authentica's `reference_id` is stored in `authentica_otp_log`.

| Operation | Method | Endpoint | Key Fields |
|---|---|---|---|
| Send OTP | POST | `https://api.authentica.sa/api/v2/otp/send` | Header: `X-Authorization`. Body: `{ channel: 'email'\|'sms', to: address }`. Returns: `reference_id` |
| Verify OTP | POST | `https://api.authentica.sa/api/v2/otp/verify` | Body: `{ reference_id, otp }`. Returns: `{ success: true\|false }` |

### Cal.com (Scheduling)
Used to fetch live availability and create bookings. Availability is never cached — always fetched live so stale slots are never shown.

| Operation | Method | Endpoint | Key Fields |
|---|---|---|---|
| Get availability slots | GET | `https://api.cal.com/v2/slots` | Header: `cal-api-version: 2024-09-04`. Params: `eventTypeId, start, end, timeZone` |
| Create booking | POST | `https://api.cal.com/v2/bookings` | Header: `cal-api-version: 2024-08-13`. Body: `{ start, eventTypeId, attendee: { name, email, timeZone } }`. Returns `uid` → stored as `MEETING.calcom_booking_id` |

### Daily.co (Video Meetings)
Used to create private video rooms and issue per-user meeting tokens.

| Operation | Method | Endpoint | Key Fields |
|---|---|---|---|
| Create room | POST | `https://api.daily.co/v1/rooms` | Body: `{ name, privacy: 'private', properties: { nbf, exp, max_participants: 2, eject_at_room_exp: true } }`. Returns `url` → stored as `MEETING.video_link` |
| Create meeting token | POST | `https://api.daily.co/v1/meeting-tokens` | Body: `{ properties: { room_name, user_name, is_owner, exp } }`. Returns `token`. Join URL = `video_link?t=token` |
| Delete room | DELETE | `https://api.daily.co/v1/rooms/{name}` | Called after meeting ends or is cancelled |

### Cloudflare R2 (Object Storage)
S3-compatible storage. Object keys (not full URLs) are stored in the database. Full URL = `R2_PUBLIC_URL + '/' + key`.

| What is stored | Key format |
|---|---|
| User avatar | `avatars/{user_id}.{ext}` |
| NDA signature image | `contracts/{contract_id}/sig_p1.png` or `sig_p2.png` |
| Intermediate PDF | `contracts/{contract_id}/signed_p1.pdf` |
| Final contract PDF | `contracts/{contract_id}/final.pdf` |
| Chat file attachment | `chat/{project_id}/{year}/{month}/{uuid}.{ext}` |
| Project file | `files/{project_id}/{folder}/{uuid}.{ext}` |

#### POST `/meeting-requests/{id}/accept`
**What happens internally (in order):**

5. `[Internal]` Creates `ChatChannel` + `ChatMember` rows for both parties
6. `[Internal]` Sends NDA signing emails via Gmail SMTP

**Response `200`:**
```json

### Contracts (NDA)

> **Internal endpoint — external services called behind the scenes.**
> The client only submits a base64 PNG signature and receives a status response.
> All external calls (R2 upload, PDF generation, Gmail email) are invisible to the frontend.

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/contracts/sign/{token}` | Token only | Contract preview for the signing page — token itself is the credential, no JWT needed |
| POST | `/contracts/sign/{token}` | Token only | Submit digital signature → **[Internal → R2 + Gmail]** signature PNG uploaded to R2 → PDF generated and stored in R2 → signing email sent via Gmail SMTP → if party two signs: `Meeting.is_accessible = true` |
| GET | `/contracts/{id}` | Yes | Retrieve signed contract including `generated_pdf_key` |

#### What happens inside `POST /contracts/sign/{token}` (in order):

1. `[Internal]` Validate token → identify which party (one or two) is signing
2. `[External → R2]` Upload signature PNG to `contracts/{contract_id}/sig_p1.png` or `sig_p2.png`
3. `[Internal]` Overlay signature on the NDA PDF using PyMuPDF
4. `[External → R2]` Store the resulting PDF:
   - If party one → `contracts/{contract_id}/signed_p1.pdf` (intermediate)
   - If party two → `contracts/{contract_id}/final.pdf` (final, fully signed)
5. `[External → Gmail SMTP]` Send email:
   - If party one signed → send signing link to party two
   - If party two signed → send final PDF link to both parties
6. `[Internal]` Update `CONTRACT.status`:
   - Party one signs → `pending_party_two`
   - Party two signs → `signed` + set `MEETING.is_accessible = true`

**Response `200` (Party One signs):**
```json
{
  "contract_id": "uuid",
  "status": "pending_party_two",
  "party_one_signed_at": "2026-06-24T11:00:00.000Z",
  "message": "Signature recorded. NDA sent to the other party for signing."
}
```

**Response `200` (Party Two signs — fully signed):**
```json
{
  "contract_id": "uuid",
  "status": "signed",
  "party_two_signed_at": "2026-06-24T12:00:00.000Z",
  "generated_pdf_url": "https://r2.bayn.sa/contracts/uuid/final.pdf",
  "meeting": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "start_time": "2026-07-01T09:00:00.000Z",
    "video_link": "https://bayn.daily.co/meeting-uuid",
    "is_accessible": true
  },
  "message": "NDA fully signed. The meeting is now accessible."
}

## API Classification Summary

| # | Method | Endpoint | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | POST | `/projects/{id}/meeting-requests` | Internal | Stored in DB |
| 2 | GET | `/meeting-requests` | Internal | DB query |
| 3 | POST | `/meeting-requests/{id}/accept` | Internal → [Cal.com + Daily.co] | Calls external APIs behind the scenes |
| 4 | POST | `/meeting-requests/{id}/reject` | Internal | DB update |
| 5 | GET | `/contracts/sign/{token}` | Internal | Token-secured, no JWT needed |
| 6 | POST | `/contracts/sign/{token}` | Internal → [R2 + Gmail SMTP] | Signature stored in R2, PDF generated in R2, email sent via Gmail |
| 7 | GET | `/projects/{id}/chat` | Internal | DB query |
| 8 | GET | `/projects/{id}/chat/messages` | Internal | DB query + pagination |
| 9 | POST | `/projects/{id}/chat/upload` | Internal → [R2] | File stored in R2, URL returned |
| 10 | WS | `/ws/projects/{id}/chat` | Internal (FastAPI WS) | No external service — pure FastAPI WebSocket |

> **Note:** Endpoints 3, 6, and 9 are internal from the client's perspective but call external services behind the scenes:
> - **Endpoint 3** calls Cal.com (create booking) and Daily.co (create private room)
> - **Endpoint 6** uploads the signature PNG to Cloudflare R2, generates the signed PDF and stores it in R2, then sends the signing link or final PDF via Gmail SMTP — the client only submits a base64 PNG and receives a status response
> - **Endpoint 9** uploads the file to Cloudflare R2 and returns the file URL
>
> The client never interacts with Cal.com, Daily.co, Cloudflare R2, or Gmail directly.

## Scalability and Efficiency

The architecture separates the system into independent components: frontend, backend, database, storage, scheduling, meetings, email, and real-time chat. This separation makes the MVP easier to maintain, test, and scale.

- **React** — flexible and responsive user interface
- **FastAPI** — lightweight async backend with built-in WebSocket support for real-time chat
- **PostgreSQL** — reliable structured storage for all platform data
- **Cal.com** — scheduling without building a calendar engine from scratch
- **Daily.co** — video rooms without managing WebRTC infrastructure
- **Cloudflare R2** — scalable object storage with CDN delivery and zero egress fees
- **Gmail SMTP** — transactional email for OTP, NDA signing links, and notifications
- **FastAPI WebSocket** — real-time chat handled natively by the backend, no third-party dependency
